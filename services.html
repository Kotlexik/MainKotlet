                <p>Hi, this is my first ever blog on here. Since nothing eventful happened today though I'll just yap about making this website! BTW this is my first ever proper website that I've personally designed and carefully crafted, so I will not hear any criticism, except for my teacher's (whoevers grading this please have mercy). So let's start at the beginning, before there was the welcome page, there was nothing. That's when the mighty Kotlet said "Let there be mint" and thus the welcome page was formed (and by proxy also every page cause i just ctrl+c ctrl+v'd the page i made into the others). </p>

                </div>
                <p>Ok so, before i make anyone read the 500 page novel that's ahead I'm gonna write a quick <br>TLDR: i finished the site (Woohoo!), it gave me immense mental pain (Oh no!), I can now play games (Woohoo!).<br>Anyways I am in tears. This <important>STUPID</important> website has been constantly breaking. Any time i added something to the CSS files the styling broooooookee. I HATE styling (just kidding i don't mind it) and JavaScript can go erase itself from existance</p>
