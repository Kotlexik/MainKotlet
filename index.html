                <p>Welcome, to my minty fresh website. I am Kotlecik, the creator of this website, and I will be your source of entertainment for the next couple of minutes before you inevitably get bored and leave to go watch youtube. If you decide to stay a little longer you may discover that I've put a whoooooooole lot of effort into this creation, and maybe you'll even revisit it one day (please do)</p>

                <p>Technically this is my second website ever (I'm a web development prodigy, I know) but it is only the first one that I have personally designed, developed and produced, so all this beauty may be changed somepoint in the future. Make sure you check out every single page, because each one looks ever so slightly different, <sub>and it would be a shame if i put all that time into them just for them to never be seen</sub>.</p>
