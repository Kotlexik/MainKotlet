Hi, thanks for reading me. Here's a short overview of the project and how to run it on your computer! (locally or just through the web)
Firstly this is a short 5 page project that is meant to be a blog all about me.
Included pages are as follows: The main page; quick intro to the website, the about page; explains who I am and why this website exists, the gallery page; includes 6 of my favourite things, the blog page; containing blog entries of given days, and lastly a contact page; self explanatory


LOCAL:
to run this locally just download the files (all of them) and then open index.html with the web browser of your choice.

WEB:
just click this link : https://kotlexik.github.io/MainKotlet/

Now without further ado please go visit the Website
